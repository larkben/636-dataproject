Time to buy stock that has a similar trajectory to nvidia before it topped out. My opinion is that rocket labs  and asts are good investments for the future.,-1,1732032455.0
"High p/e stocks have a higher volatility. Say Tesla if it was a boring company doing the same thing for 20 years would have a value of maybe 40. Currently trades 320. So a huge percentage of the value is based on markets opinion of future growth in profits, basically sentinent. If that sentiment changes there is a far higher percentage of the valuation of the share to discount or not.",5,1731879662.0
"Kind of hoping for momentum leading up to earnings and might cash out before then. I can‚Äôt imagine they won‚Äôt post good numbers and guidance, strong ‚Äúmaga‚Äù support there too I think (just my opinion from my experiences shopping there). 

Any thoughts?",1,1731704870.0
"I feel like it will def move, but if it goes up I see it as possible to get 50% or more day 1, if it.goes down I see .80 .70 at the lowest. I do not see it staying in the 1.00 to 1.20 range.

This is an extremely low float micro cap stock relative to anything else we see on this sub. 

This is why I personally am doing like 90% shares, and only a few calls. Options are expensive for this as iv is literally like 200%. I won't tell you what to do,  but my opinion is that it will more violently in either direction and I'm leaning 80/20 to the updside.",2,1731840427.0
