"I played some WMT 90c calendars, short 90c this week and long 90c for next week. risk is lower then buying calls outright. I think likely if WMT beats, that it will move above 90 temporarily then fall back down a bit.

If not, whatever. I plan to buy tgt puts if WMT beats",2,1731949217.0

"My only issue with TGT is the IV is double that of WMT and the big play isn't really there. Not all of WMT's groceries come from the US and as to what degree it's really hard to even know. I know they say 2/3 of all their groceries are from the US but WMT is notorious for lying to promote their image. I don't think they are going to have a bad earnings and I think they will beat across the board. 

What I'm looking for here is a revised future earnings to the downside in anticipation of the tariff war and turbulence of the uncertainty the new cabinet nominations bring to the US and her trading partners. With the mood of the current market a weaker future earnings guidance could be all it takes. Shaving 5%-10% off the stock's price would still put it up 50% on the year.",4,1731782534.0

"Bud I've doubled my port in a month.

So everything I said in the other comment is true, except you weren't even sure about the play. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31224)

And got so worked up because I hit the nail on the head

And why the fuck is TGT in the conversation now ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

We both knew TGT was going to dump

Post your positions

God damn I hurt you by simply pointing out WMT 90c was a bad play

""Bu.. bu... I knew TGT was going to dump ![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787)""

TGT dumping only proves what I said about a consumer stock like this only hitting 20% change when it's down

Who cares, dude. And who cares you made a bad play on WMT

You need to take emotion out of trading immediately and simply learn from your mistakes rather than get all weird and defensive",1,1732115434.0
