"**Summary for Weekly Earnings Thread 11/18 - 11/22**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Market Vibe Check**: üìâ The sentiment is mixed but leaning bearish ahead of major earnings reports next week, with traders on edge about NVDA's upcoming release setting the tone for tech. Concerns over inflation and macroeconomic indicators are also adding to caution.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Top Stock Plays**: 
- **[$NVDA](https://x.com/search?q=%24NVDA&src=cashtag_click)**: üé¢ High anticipation; expecting volatility. If they beat, bulls could charge, but a miss could send shockwaves.
- **[$WMT](https://x.com/search?q=%24WMT&src=cashtag_click)**: üéØ Calls are popular; traders are banking on holiday sales driving a 90 strike jump post-earnings. Watch for consumer sentiment.
- **[$SNOW](https://x.com/search?q=%24SNOW&src=cashtag_click)**: ‚ùÑÔ∏è Mixed feelings; historically volatile post-earnings. Expecting a possible bounce but high risk due to recent downgrades.
- **[$PANW](https://x.com/search?q=%24PANW&src=cashtag_click)**: üîí Buzz around calls; history shows the stock dips post-earnings despite beating.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Rising Stars**: 
- **[$SYM](https://x.com/search?q=%24SYM&src=cashtag_click)**: üöÄ Surging mentions; potential breakout play, currently gaining momentum.
- **[$ZTO](https://x.com/search?q=%24ZTO&src=cashtag_click)**: üì¶ Increasing chatter as interest builds; traders looking for a dip buy opportunity based on earnings.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Hidden Gems**: 
- **[$JACK](https://x.com/search?q=%24JACK&src=cashtag_click)**: üçî Strong positive vibes from recent earnings; could attract more attention post-earnings.
- **[$GAP](https://x.com/search?q=%24GAP&src=cashtag_click)**: üëñ Possible recovery play; analysts hint at potential upside after recent underperformance.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Forecast & Actionable Insights**: 
- **$NVDA**: ‚ö†Ô∏è If you're risking it, consider a straddle to capitalize on expected volatility; timing is key. Maybe grab puts if you're bearish.
- **$WMT**: üí° Lock in some profits from calls pre-earnings; market seems to expect a pop, but be prepared for a sell-off.
- **$SNOW**: ‚òÉÔ∏è Short puts might be a way to capitalize on a rebound if the market gives it a bump after earnings.
- **Diversify**: üå™Ô∏è Keep an eye on correlated tech stocks like $MU for hedging NVDA plays to manage risk better.

"I got x11 90C 12/20 when calls price was at $0.40 My plan is to sell after earnings if it goes up decently. The problem with holding til December to see if it goes higher it‚Äôs the gains being burned by theta. Remember Walmart is not known for being volatile, when you see gains you sell and then start again with a farthest date, doing the snowball effect with the gains. 

If you‚Äôre taking long calls, you should sell when u see at least +100% gains and then roll position. I've been doing this since Walmart was at $50~ and it worked for me. 

You can always buy shares as hedge, Walmart is very promising and decent.",2,1731875259.0
