"""which company has the biggest potential to move to the up or downside""

# ChatGPT said:

Among the companies reporting earnings tomorrow, **Elastic (ESTC)** and **Intuit (INTU)** appear to have significant potential for stock movement.

1. **Elastic (ESTC):** Analysts expect notable volatility due to its high-growth profile and focus on AI-driven enterprise software. Its performance depends on cloud adoption trends and margin improvements​.
2. **Intuit (INTU):** Intuit's results could be pivotal given its substantial institutional ownership (83%) and recent concerns over insider stock sales. Its flagship products (e.g., TurboTax) are highly sensitive to guidance revisions​.

Both companies are in sectors with growth drivers but face differing risks, making them likely candidates for big price reactions post-earnings.

""in which direction""

# ChatGPT said:

1. **Elastic (ESTC):** Likely **upside potential** if it beats expectations for revenue growth and cloud adoption, as it has historically responded positively to strong results. However, high valuations could magnify downside if it misses guidance​.
2. **Intuit (INTU):** Mixed sentiment. Strong results in its small business and AI offerings could push it **up**, but recent insider sales and sector-wide competitive pressures suggest possible **downside risk**​.

Markets currently favor **Elastic** for upside and are cautious on **Intuit**.

""how big of a positive move do you think is possible given all the information available to you""

# ChatGPT said:

1. **Elastic (ESTC):** Potential for a **10-15% upside**, as growth stocks in the software sector often react strongly to earnings beats, particularly if revenue growth or margins exceed expectations. Recent AI-driven product developments could amplify optimism​.
2. **Intuit (INTU):** A **5-10% positive move** is plausible if its small business ecosystem and AI tools outperform expectations. However, its high market cap may limit extreme upside unless guidance surprises significantly

"**Summary for Weekly Earnings Thread 11/18 - 11/22**

1️⃣ **Market Vibe Check**: 📉 The sentiment is mixed but leaning bearish ahead of major earnings reports next week, with traders on edge about NVDA's upcoming release setting the tone for tech. Concerns over inflation and macroeconomic indicators are also adding to caution.

2️⃣ **Top Stock Plays**: 
- **[$NVDA](https://x.com/search?q=%24NVDA&src=cashtag_click)**: 🎢 High anticipation; expecting volatility. If they beat, bulls could charge, but a miss could send shockwaves.
- **[$WMT](https://x.com/search?q=%24WMT&src=cashtag_click)**: 🎯 Calls are popular; traders are banking on holiday sales driving a 90 strike jump post-earnings. Watch for consumer sentiment.
- **[$SNOW](https://x.com/search?q=%24SNOW&src=cashtag_click)**: ❄️ Mixed feelings; historically volatile post-earnings. Expecting a possible bounce but high risk due to recent downgrades.
- **[$PANW](https://x.com/search?q=%24PANW&src=cashtag_click)**: 🔒 Buzz around calls; history shows the stock dips post-earnings despite beating.

3️⃣ **Rising Stars**: 
- **[$SYM](https://x.com/search?q=%24SYM&src=cashtag_click)**: 🚀 Surging mentions; potential breakout play, currently gaining momentum.
- **[$ZTO](https://x.com/search?q=%24ZTO&src=cashtag_click)**: 📦 Increasing chatter as interest builds; traders looking for a dip buy opportunity based on earnings.

4️⃣ **Hidden Gems**: 
- **[$JACK](https://x.com/search?q=%24JACK&src=cashtag_click)**: 🍔 Strong positive vibes from recent earnings; could attract more attention post-earnings.
- **[$GAP](https://x.com/search?q=%24GAP&src=cashtag_click)**: 👖 Possible recovery play; analysts hint at potential upside after recent underperformance.

5️⃣ **Forecast & Actionable Insights**: 
- **$NVDA**: ⚠️ If you're risking it, consider a straddle to capitalize on expected volatility; timing is key. Maybe grab puts if you're bearish.
- **$WMT**: 💡 Lock in some profits from calls pre-earnings; market seems to expect a pop, but be prepared for a sell-off.
- **$SNOW**: ☃️ Short puts might be a way to capitalize on a rebound if the market gives it a bump after earnings.
- **Diversify**: 🌪️ Keep an eye on correlated tech stocks like $MU for hedging NVDA plays to manage risk better.

If you’re taking long calls, you should sell when u see at least +100% gains and then roll position. I've been doing this since Walmart was at $50~ and it worked for me.

"**Summary for Weekly Earnings Thread 11/18 - 11/22**

1️⃣ **Market Vibe Check**: 📉 The sentiment is mixed but leaning bearish ahead of major earnings reports next week, with traders on edge about NVDA's upcoming release setting the tone for tech. Concerns over inflation and macroeconomic indicators are also adding to caution.

2️⃣ **Top Stock Plays**: 
- **[$NVDA](https://x.com/search?q=%24NVDA&src=cashtag_click)**: 🎢 High anticipation; expecting volatility. If they beat, bulls could charge, but a miss could send shockwaves.
- **[$WMT](https://x.com/search?q=%24WMT&src=cashtag_click)**: 🎯 Calls are popular; traders are banking on holiday sales driving a 90 strike jump post-earnings. Watch for consumer sentiment.
- **[$SNOW](https://x.com/search?q=%24SNOW&src=cashtag_click)**: ❄️ Mixed feelings; historically volatile post-earnings. Expecting a possible bounce but high risk due to recent downgrades.
- **[$PANW](https://x.com/search?q=%24PANW&src=cashtag_click)**: 🔒 Buzz around calls; history shows the stock dips post-earnings despite beating.

3️⃣ **Rising Stars**: 
- **[$SYM](https://x.com/search?q=%24SYM&src=cashtag_click)**: 🚀 Surging mentions; potential breakout play, currently gaining momentum.
- **[$ZTO](https://x.com/search?q=%24ZTO&src=cashtag_click)**: 📦 Increasing chatter as interest builds; traders looking for a dip buy opportunity based on earnings.

4️⃣ **Hidden Gems**: 
- **[$JACK](https://x.com/search?q=%24JACK&src=cashtag_click)**: 🍔 Strong positive vibes from recent earnings; could attract more attention post-earnings.
- **[$GAP](https://x.com/search?q=%24GAP&src=cashtag_click)**: 👖 Possible recovery play; analysts hint at potential upside after recent underperformance.

5️⃣ **Forecast & Actionable Insights**: 
- **$NVDA**: ⚠️ If you're risking it, consider a straddle to capitalize on expected volatility; timing is key. Maybe grab puts if you're bearish.
- **$WMT**: 💡 Lock in some profits from calls pre-earnings; market seems to expect a pop, but be prepared for a sell-off.
- **$SNOW**: ☃️ Short puts might be a way to capitalize on a rebound if the market gives it a bump after earnings.
- **Diversify**: 🌪️ Keep an eye on correlated tech stocks like $MU for hedging NVDA plays to manage risk better.

I don't think they are going to have a bad earnings and I think they will beat across the board. 

What I'm looking for here is a revised future earnings to the downside in anticipation of the tariff war and turbulence of the uncertainty the new cabinet nominations bring to the US and her trading partners.

"**Summary for Weekly Earnings Thread 11/18 - 11/22**

1️⃣ **Market Vibe Check**: 📉 The sentiment is mixed but leaning bearish ahead of major earnings reports next week, with traders on edge about NVDA's upcoming release setting the tone for tech. Concerns over inflation and macroeconomic indicators are also adding to caution.

2️⃣ **Top Stock Plays**: 
- **[$NVDA](https://x.com/search?q=%24NVDA&src=cashtag_click)**: 🎢 High anticipation; expecting volatility. If they beat, bulls could charge, but a miss could send shockwaves.
- **[$WMT](https://x.com/search?q=%24WMT&src=cashtag_click)**: 🎯 Calls are popular; traders are banking on holiday sales driving a 90 strike jump post-earnings. Watch for consumer sentiment.
- **[$SNOW](https://x.com/search?q=%24SNOW&src=cashtag_click)**: ❄️ Mixed feelings; historically volatile post-earnings. Expecting a possible bounce but high risk due to recent downgrades.
- **[$PANW](https://x.com/search?q=%24PANW&src=cashtag_click)**: 🔒 Buzz around calls; history shows the stock dips post-earnings despite beating.

3️⃣ **Rising Stars**: 
- **[$SYM](https://x.com/search?q=%24SYM&src=cashtag_click)**: 🚀 Surging mentions; potential breakout play, currently gaining momentum.
- **[$ZTO](https://x.com/search?q=%24ZTO&src=cashtag_click)**: 📦 Increasing chatter as interest builds; traders looking for a dip buy opportunity based on earnings.

4️⃣ **Hidden Gems**: 
- **[$JACK](https://x.com/search?q=%24JACK&src=cashtag_click)**: 🍔 Strong positive vibes from recent earnings; could attract more attention post-earnings.
- **[$GAP](https://x.com/search?q=%24GAP&src=cashtag_click)**: 👖 Possible recovery play; analysts hint at potential upside after recent underperformance.

5️⃣ **Forecast & Actionable Insights**: 
- **$NVDA**: ⚠️ If you're risking it, consider a straddle to capitalize on expected volatility; timing is key. Maybe grab puts if you're bearish.
- **$WMT**: 💡 Lock in some profits from calls pre-earnings; market seems to expect a pop, but be prepared for a sell-off.
- **$SNOW**: ☃️ Short puts might be a way to capitalize on a rebound if the market gives it a bump after earnings.
- **Diversify**: 🌪️ Keep an eye on correlated tech stocks like $MU for hedging NVDA plays to manage risk better.

I think the realization of how dumb the next four years are going to be started to sink in before the weekend and tariffs are going to absolutely crush WMT's profit since they rely on cheaply made foreign goods. The US does not have the manufacturing capability to produce these goods and even if we did it would be much more expensive and it would be a couple of years before they could even get those items off an assembly line.

I could be incredibly wrong but I'm willing to pick up a few 11/22 $78 puts to see.

Almost have the feeling like it's May 2022 again. WMT was trading at $148 ish before reporting and $135 puts were $35 and $130 were $17 a contract. By the end of the week WMT was at $120.",7,1731773826.0,wmt

I know they say 2/3 of all their groceries are from the US but WMT is notorious for lying to promote their image. I don't think they are going to have a bad earnings and I think they will beat across the board. 

What I'm looking for here is a revised future earnings to the downside in anticipation of the tariff war and turbulence of the uncertainty the new cabinet nominations bring to the US and her trading partners.
