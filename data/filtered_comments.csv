Yoni_AZ,"Man I always pick the loser, looking at you ARM. I suck at this",11,1730927798.0
2QuarterDollar,"Thoughts for discussion

ARM reported horrible guidance and is only down 6% why is that ? Well it’s because SoftBank still owns 90% as of their July statements and only 10% is available for float.

So hold on to your puts because this thing can go much lower once the 10% retail starts selling. SoftBank has this incredible luxury problem where they have 90% stake in a company that is up 200% but they cannot offload their shares in the open market. Even a 10% sell would increase the float from the 10 to 20% right?

Anyway hold on to your puts cause ARM could dip below 100 soon",9,1730955230.0

Overvalued/Puts - ARM, ANET, PLTR, DDOG, TTD, ALAB, NVO

GovernorHarryLogan,"I'm betting on regards this week.

HIMS because people are spending whatever money they can for compounded semaglitude.  Not sure how drug compounding works?  Well when a drug is a shortage -- like glp-1s -- a compounding pharmacy can just mash that shit together and make up for the shortage (usually for less)  so chicks are jacking themselves with sematlitude 

As for the regarded dudes?

Draft kings.  These dudes want to get these new hotties and see gamblin as their only hope.  So these regards have racked up like $30k in credit card debt playing 12 game parlays and shit. 

HIMS and DKNG
