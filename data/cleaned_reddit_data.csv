"""which company has the biggest potential to move to the up or downside""

# ChatGPT said:

Among the companies reporting earnings tomorrow, **Elastic (ESTC)** and **Intuit (INTU)** appear to have significant potential for stock movement.

1. **Elastic (ESTC):** Analysts expect notable volatility due to its high-growth profile and focus on AI-driven enterprise software. Its performance depends on cloud adoption trends and margin improvements​.
2. **Intuit (INTU):** Intuit's results could be pivotal given its substantial institutional ownership (83%) and recent concerns over insider stock sales. Its flagship products (e.g., TurboTax) are highly sensitive to guidance revisions​.

Both companies are in sectors with growth drivers but face differing risks, making them likely candidates for big price reactions post-earnings.

""in which direction""

# ChatGPT said:

1. **Elastic (ESTC):** Likely **upside potential** if it beats expectations for revenue growth and cloud adoption, as it has historically responded positively to strong results. However, high valuations could magnify downside if it misses guidance​.
2. **Intuit (INTU):** Mixed sentiment. Strong results in its small business and AI offerings could push it **up**, but recent insider sales and sector-wide competitive pressures suggest possible **downside risk**​.

Markets currently favor **Elastic** for upside and are cautious on **Intuit**.

""how big of a positive move do you think is possible given all the information available to you""

# ChatGPT said:

1. **Elastic (ESTC):** Potential for a **10-15% upside**, as growth stocks in the software sector often react strongly to earnings beats, particularly if revenue growth or margins exceed expectations. Recent AI-driven product developments could amplify optimism​.
2. **Intuit (INTU):** A **5-10% positive move** is plausible if its small business ecosystem and AI tools outperform expectations. However, its high market cap may limit extreme upside unless guidance surprises significantly

"**Summary for Weekly Earnings Thread 11/18 - 11/22**

1️⃣ **Market Vibe Check**: 📉 The sentiment is mixed but leaning bearish ahead of major earnings reports next week, with traders on edge about NVDA's upcoming release setting the tone for tech. Concerns over inflation and macroeconomic indicators are also adding to caution.

2️⃣ **Top Stock Plays**: 
- **[$NVDA](https://x.com/search?q=%24NVDA&src=cashtag_click)**: 🎢 High anticipation; expecting volatility. If they beat, bulls could charge, but a miss could send shockwaves.
- **[$WMT](https://x.com/search?q=%24WMT&src=cashtag_click)**: 🎯 Calls are popular; traders are banking on holiday sales driving a 90 strike jump post-earnings. Watch for consumer sentiment.
- **[$SNOW](https://x.com/search?q=%24SNOW&src=cashtag_click)**: ❄️ Mixed feelings; historically volatile post-earnings. Expecting a possible bounce but high risk due to recent downgrades.
- **[$PANW](https://x.com/search?q=%24PANW&src=cashtag_click)**: 🔒 Buzz around calls; history shows the stock dips post-earnings despite beating.

3️⃣ **Rising Stars**: 
- **[$SYM](https://x.com/search?q=%24SYM&src=cashtag_click)**: 🚀 Surging mentions; potential breakout play, currently gaining momentum.
- **[$ZTO](https://x.com/search?q=%24ZTO&src=cashtag_click)**: 📦 Increasing chatter as interest builds; traders looking for a dip buy opportunity based on earnings.

4️⃣ **Hidden Gems**: 
- **[$JACK](https://x.com/search?q=%24JACK&src=cashtag_click)**: 🍔 Strong positive vibes from recent earnings; could attract more attention post-earnings.
- **[$GAP](https://x.com/search?q=%24GAP&src=cashtag_click)**: 👖 Possible recovery play; analysts hint at potential upside after recent underperformance.

5️⃣ **Forecast & Actionable Insights**: 
- **$NVDA**: ⚠️ If you're risking it, consider a straddle to capitalize on expected volatility; timing is key. Maybe grab puts if you're bearish.
- **$WMT**: 💡 Lock in some profits from calls pre-earnings; market seems to expect a pop, but be prepared for a sell-off.
- **$SNOW**: ☃️ Short puts might be a way to capitalize on a rebound if the market gives it a bump after earnings.
- **Diversify**: 🌪️ Keep an eye on correlated tech stocks like $MU for hedging NVDA plays to manage risk better.

the world's most valuable company will certainly have an impact on all 3 indexes either way. market broke ATH after earnings after we had a broader market sell off around September 5th off of inflation numbers and then J Pow confirming / subsequently cutting interest rates. Market would not have made ATH if NVDA never recovered quickly from low 100s back to 130-140 range.,1,nvda,2024-11-15

"Have you heard of this stock called NVDA? 

My brother's hairdresser's dog told him about it

He says it's going to the moon

It will definitely do that because that's what some random person told me it will do

I'm not even going to do any of my own research on it

Think it'll print? Picked it up Friday close after 2% dip on the stock price.

"I got x11 90C 12/20 when calls price was at $0.40 My plan is to sell after earnings if it goes up decently. The problem with holding til December to see if it goes higher it’s the gains being burned by theta. Remember Walmart is not known for being volatile, when you see gains you sell and then start again with a farthest date, doing the snowball effect with the gains. 

If you’re taking long calls, you should sell when u see at least +100% gains and then roll position. I've been doing this since Walmart was at $50~ and it worked for me. 

You can always buy shares as hedge, Walmart is very promising and decent.",2,snow,2024-11-17

"**Summary for Weekly Earnings Thread 11/18 - 11/22**

1️⃣ **Market Vibe Check**: 📉 The sentiment is mixed but leaning bearish ahead of major earnings reports next week, with traders on edge about NVDA's upcoming release setting the tone for tech. Concerns over inflation and macroeconomic indicators are also adding to caution.

2️⃣ **Top Stock Plays**: 
- **[$NVDA](https://x.com/search?q=%24NVDA&src=cashtag_click)**: 🎢 High anticipation; expecting volatility. If they beat, bulls could charge, but a miss could send shockwaves.
- **[$WMT](https://x.com/search?q=%24WMT&src=cashtag_click)**: 🎯 Calls are popular; traders are banking on holiday sales driving a 90 strike jump post-earnings. Watch for consumer sentiment.
- **[$SNOW](https://x.com/search?q=%24SNOW&src=cashtag_click)**: ❄️ Mixed feelings; historically volatile post-earnings. Expecting a possible bounce but high risk due to recent downgrades.
- **[$PANW](https://x.com/search?q=%24PANW&src=cashtag_click)**: 🔒 Buzz around calls; history shows the stock dips post-earnings despite beating.

3️⃣ **Rising Stars**: 
- **[$SYM](https://x.com/search?q=%24SYM&src=cashtag_click)**: 🚀 Surging mentions; potential breakout play, currently gaining momentum.
- **[$ZTO](https://x.com/search?q=%24ZTO&src=cashtag_click)**: 📦 Increasing chatter as interest builds; traders looking for a dip buy opportunity based on earnings.

4️⃣ **Hidden Gems**: 
- **[$JACK](https://x.com/search?q=%24JACK&src=cashtag_click)**: 🍔 Strong positive vibes from recent earnings; could attract more attention post-earnings.
- **[$GAP](https://x.com/search?q=%24GAP&src=cashtag_click)**: 👖 Possible recovery play; analysts hint at potential upside after recent underperformance.

5️⃣ **Forecast & Actionable Insights**: 
- **$NVDA**: ⚠️ If you're risking it, consider a straddle to capitalize on expected volatility; timing is key. Maybe grab puts if you're bearish.
- **$WMT**: 💡 Lock in some profits from calls pre-earnings; market seems to expect a pop, but be prepared for a sell-off.
- **$SNOW**: ☃️ Short puts might be a way to capitalize on a rebound if the market gives it a bump after earnings.
- **Diversify**: 🌪️ Keep an eye on correlated tech stocks like $MU for hedging NVDA plays to manage risk better.

I know they say 2/3 of all their groceries are from the US but WMT is notorious for lying to promote their image. I don't think they are going to have a bad earnings and I think they will beat across the board. 

What I'm looking for here is a revised future earnings to the downside in anticipation of the tariff war and turbulence of the uncertainty the new cabinet nominations bring to the US and her trading partners.

"**Summary for Weekly Earnings Thread 11/18 - 11/22**

1️⃣ **Market Vibe Check**: 📉 The sentiment is mixed but leaning bearish ahead of major earnings reports next week, with traders on edge about NVDA's upcoming release setting the tone for tech. Concerns over inflation and macroeconomic indicators are also adding to caution.

2️⃣ **Top Stock Plays**: 
- **[$NVDA](https://x.com/search?q=%24NVDA&src=cashtag_click)**: 🎢 High anticipation; expecting volatility. If they beat, bulls could charge, but a miss could send shockwaves.
- **[$WMT](https://x.com/search?q=%24WMT&src=cashtag_click)**: 🎯 Calls are popular; traders are banking on holiday sales driving a 90 strike jump post-earnings. Watch for consumer sentiment.
- **[$SNOW](https://x.com/search?q=%24SNOW&src=cashtag_click)**: ❄️ Mixed feelings; historically volatile post-earnings. Expecting a possible bounce but high risk due to recent downgrades.
- **[$PANW](https://x.com/search?q=%24PANW&src=cashtag_click)**: 🔒 Buzz around calls; history shows the stock dips post-earnings despite beating.

3️⃣ **Rising Stars**: 
- **[$SYM](https://x.com/search?q=%24SYM&src=cashtag_click)**: 🚀 Surging mentions; potential breakout play, currently gaining momentum.
- **[$ZTO](https://x.com/search?q=%24ZTO&src=cashtag_click)**: 📦 Increasing chatter as interest builds; traders looking for a dip buy opportunity based on earnings.

4️⃣ **Hidden Gems**: 
- **[$JACK](https://x.com/search?q=%24JACK&src=cashtag_click)**: 🍔 Strong positive vibes from recent earnings; could attract more attention post-earnings.
- **[$GAP](https://x.com/search?q=%24GAP&src=cashtag_click)**: 👖 Possible recovery play; analysts hint at potential upside after recent underperformance.

5️⃣ **Forecast & Actionable Insights**: 
- **$NVDA**: ⚠️ If you're risking it, consider a straddle to capitalize on expected volatility; timing is key. Maybe grab puts if you're bearish.
- **$WMT**: 💡 Lock in some profits from calls pre-earnings; market seems to expect a pop, but be prepared for a sell-off.
- **$SNOW**: ☃️ Short puts might be a way to capitalize on a rebound if the market gives it a bump after earnings.
- **Diversify**: 🌪️ Keep an eye on correlated tech stocks like $MU for hedging NVDA plays to manage risk better.

"I mean, it's only up 60% so far this year and another 10% would be pretty crazy for a stock that never moved like that before. Not even a year since the 3:1 split and it's pretty much halfway back to the pre split price.

I think the realization of how dumb the next four years are going to be started to sink in before the weekend and tariffs are going to absolutely crush WMT's profit since they rely on cheaply made foreign goods. The US does not have the manufacturing capability to produce these goods and even if we did it would be much more expensive and it would be a couple of years before they could even get those items off an assembly line.

I could be incredibly wrong but I'm willing to pick up a few 11/22 $78 puts to see.

Almost have the feeling like it's May 2022 again. WMT was trading at $148 ish before reporting and $135 puts were $35 and $130 were $17 a contract. By the end of the week WMT was at $120.",7,wmt,2024-11-16

So I'm sitting it out

But turbo tax and credit karma are powerhouses so I could be wrong on the movement. I just feel eyes are on different sectors at the moment so it would probably be more of a WMT thing unless it's a miss/dump",2,wmt,2024-11-19

"My only issue with TGT is the IV is double that of WMT and the big play isn't really there. Not all of WMT's groceries come from the US and as to what degree it's really hard to even know. I know they say 2/3 of all their groceries are from the US but WMT is notorious for lying to promote their image. I don't think they are going to have a bad earnings and I think they will beat across the board. 

What I'm looking for here is a revised future earnings to the downside in anticipation of the tariff war and turbulence of the uncertainty the new cabinet nominations bring to the US and her trading partners. With the mood of the current market a weaker future earnings guidance could be all it takes. Shaving 5%-10% off the stock's price would still put it up 50% on the year.",4,wmt,2024-11-16
